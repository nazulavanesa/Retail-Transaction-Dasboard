## A. Key Performance Indicators 📊

  KPI analysis is conducted to measure overall business performance, including:

  - Total Revenue  
  - Total Profit
  - Total Customer
  - Total Orders  
  - Total Quantity Sold
    
  These indicators provide a high-level overview of sales performance, profitability, and customer purchasing behavior.

## B. Business Questions 📌
This dashboard answers several key business questions, including:

- How is the overall transaction performance of the business in terms of revenue, profit, and number of orders?
- How does sales performance change over time (monthly trend)?
- Which payment methods contribute the most to revenue and transaction volume?
- Which product categories generate the highest revenue and quantity sold?
- How does profit compare to revenue across categories?

## C. Insight 💡
- Total revenue reached $8.7B with a total profit of $2.0B from 5,764 orders, indicating that the business operates with a relatively healthy profit margin and a sustainable revenue model.
- Sales fluctuated, with the highest peak occurring around mid to late 2022, followed by a sharp decline towards the end of the period, suggesting potential seasonality or the impact of external factors.
- COD and Pay Axis payment methods dominate both in transaction volume and revenue, indicating strong customer preference toward these payment options.
- The Mobiles & Tablets category generated the highest revenue and quantity, making it the core driver of overall business performance.
- Some categories, such as Entertainment and Computing, show high revenue but relatively lower profit, indicating lower profit margins possibly due to higher costs or aggressive discounting.

## D. Recommendations 🔥
- Maintain current pricing strategies while focusing on cost efficiency to further increase profit margins.
- Implement targeted promotional campaigns during low-sales periods to stabilize revenue and reduce seasonal impact.
- Prioritize and optimize COD and Pay Axis payment flows while offering incentives to encourage adoption of underused payment methods.
- Allocate more marketing budget to Mobiles & Tablets and expand related product bundles to maximize revenue.
- Review pricing and discount strategies for low-margin categories to improve profitability.
